        r"""
        Function invoked when calling the pipeline for generation.

        Args:
            prompt (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                The prompt or prompts to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass `prompt_embeds`.
                instead.
            prompt_2 (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                The prompt or prompts to be sent to the `tokenizer_2` and `text_encoder_2`. If not defined, `prompt` is
                used in both text-encoders
            image (`PIL.Image.Image`):
                `Image`, or tensor representing an image batch which will be inpainted, *i.e.* parts of the image will
                be masked out with `mask_image` and repainted according to `prompt`.
            mask_image (`PIL.Image.Image`):
                `Image`, or tensor representing an image batch, to mask `image`. White pixels in the mask will be
                repainted, while black pixels will be preserved. If `mask_image` is a PIL image, it will be converted
                to a single channel (luminance) before use. If it's a tensor, it should contain one color channel (L)
                instead of 3, so the expected shape would be `(B, H, W, 1)`.
            height (`int`, *optional*, defaults to self.unet.config.sample_size * self.vae_scale_factor):
                The height in pixels of the generated image. This is set to 1024 by default for the best results.
                Anything below 512 pixels won't work well for
                [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)
                and checkpoints that are not specifically fine-tuned on low resolutions.
            width (`int`, *optional*, defaults to self.unet.config.sample_size * self.vae_scale_factor):
                The width in pixels of the generated image. This is set to 1024 by default for the best results.
                Anything below 512 pixels won't work well for
                [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)
                and checkpoints that are not specifically fine-tuned on low resolutions.
            strength (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.9999):
                Conceptually, indicates how much to transform the masked portion of the reference `image`. Must be
                between 0 and 1. `image` will be used as a starting point, adding more noise to it the larger the
                `strength`. The number of denoising steps depends on the amount of noise initially added. When
                `strength` is 1, added noise will be maximum and the denoising process will run for the full number of
                iterations specified in `num_inference_steps`. A value of 1, therefore, essentially ignores the masked
                portion of the reference `image`. Note that in the case of `denoising_start` being declared as an
                integer, the value of `strength` will be ignored.
            num_inference_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 50):
                The number of denoising steps. More denoising steps usually lead to a higher quality image at the
                expense of slower inference.
            denoising_start (`float`, *optional*):
                When specified, indicates the fraction (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the total denoising process to be
                bypassed before it is initiated. Consequently, the initial part of the denoising process is skipped and
                it is assumed that the passed `image` is a partly denoised image. Note that when this is specified,
                strength will be ignored. The `denoising_start` parameter is particularly beneficial when this pipeline
                is integrated into a "Mixture of Denoisers" multi-pipeline setup, as detailed in [**Refining the Image
                Output**](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl#refining-the-image-output).
            denoising_end (`float`, *optional*):
                When specified, determines the fraction (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the total denoising process to be
                completed before it is intentionally prematurely terminated. As a result, the returned sample will
                still retain a substantial amount of noise (ca. final 20% of timesteps still needed) and should be
                denoised by a successor pipeline that has `denoising_start` set to 0.8 so that it only denoises the
                final 20% of the scheduler. The denoising_end parameter should ideally be utilized when this pipeline
                forms a part of a "Mixture of Denoisers" multi-pipeline setup, as elaborated in [**Refining the Image
                Output**](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl#refining-the-image-output).
            guidance_scale (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 7.5):
                Guidance scale as defined in [Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).
                `guidance_scale` is defined as `w` of equation 2. of [Imagen
                Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11487.pdf). Guidance scale is enabled by setting `guidance_scale >
                1`. Higher guidance scale encourages to generate images that are closely linked to the text `prompt`,
                usually at the expense of lower image quality.
            negative_prompt (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                The prompt or prompts not to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass
                `negative_prompt_embeds` instead. Ignored when not using guidance (i.e., ignored if `guidance_scale` is
                less than `1`).
            negative_prompt_2 (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                The prompt or prompts not to guide the image generation to be sent to `tokenizer_2` and
                `text_encoder_2`. If not defined, `negative_prompt` is used in both text-encoders
            prompt_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs, *e.g.* prompt weighting. If not
                provided, text embeddings will be generated from `prompt` input argument.
            negative_prompt_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated negative text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs, *e.g.* prompt
                weighting. If not provided, negative_prompt_embeds will be generated from `negative_prompt` input
                argument.
            pooled_prompt_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated pooled text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs, *e.g.* prompt weighting.
                If not provided, pooled text embeddings will be generated from `prompt` input argument.
            negative_pooled_prompt_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated negative pooled text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs, *e.g.* prompt
                weighting. If not provided, pooled negative_prompt_embeds will be generated from `negative_prompt`
                input argument.
            num_images_per_prompt (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
                The number of images to generate per prompt.
            eta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
                Corresponds to parameter eta (η) in the DDIM paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502. Only applies to
                [`schedulers.DDIMScheduler`], will be ignored for others.
            generator (`torch.Generator`, *optional*):
                One or a list of [torch generator(s)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Generator.html)
                to make generation deterministic.
            latents (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated noisy latents, sampled from a Gaussian distribution, to be used as inputs for image
                generation. Can be used to tweak the same generation with different prompts. If not provided, a latents
                tensor will ge generated by sampling using the supplied random `generator`.
            output_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"pil"`):
                The output format of the generate image. Choose between
                [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.array`.
            return_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether or not to return a [`~pipelines.stable_diffusion.StableDiffusionPipelineOutput`] instead of a
                plain tuple.
            callback (`Callable`, *optional*):
                A function that will be called every `callback_steps` steps during inference. The function will be
                called with the following arguments: `callback(step: int, timestep: int, latents: torch.FloatTensor)`.
            callback_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
                The frequency at which the `callback` function will be called. If not specified, the callback will be
                called at every step.
            cross_attention_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
                A kwargs dictionary that if specified is passed along to the `AttentionProcessor` as defined under
                `self.processor` in
                [diffusers.models.attention_processor](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py).
            original_size (`Tuple[int]`, *optional*, defaults to (1024, 1024)):
                If `original_size` is not the same as `target_size` the image will appear to be down- or upsampled.
                `original_size` defaults to `(height, width)` if not specified. Part of SDXL's micro-conditioning as
                explained in section 2.2 of
                [https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952).
            crops_coords_top_left (`Tuple[int]`, *optional*, defaults to (0, 0)):
                `crops_coords_top_left` can be used to generate an image that appears to be "cropped" from the position
                `crops_coords_top_left` downwards. Favorable, well-centered images are usually achieved by setting
                `crops_coords_top_left` to (0, 0). Part of SDXL's micro-conditioning as explained in section 2.2 of
                [https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952).
            target_size (`Tuple[int]`, *optional*, defaults to (1024, 1024)):
                For most cases, `target_size` should be set to the desired height and width of the generated image. If
                not specified it will default to `(height, width)`. Part of SDXL's micro-conditioning as explained in
                section 2.2 of [https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952).

                To negatively condition the generation process based on a specific image resolution. Part of SDXL's
                micro-conditioning as explained in section 2.2 of
