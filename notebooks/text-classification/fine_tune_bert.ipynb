    "This guide will help you to get started with [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/?nc1=h_ls) and Hugging Face Transformers. It will cover how to set up a Trainium instance on AWS, load & fine-tune a transformers model for text-classification.\n",

    "## Quick intro: AWS Trainium\n",
    "\n",
    "[AWS Trainium (Trn1)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) is a purpose-built EC2 for deep learning (DL) training workloads. Trainium is the successor of [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/?nc1=h_ls) focused on high-performance training workloads claiming up to 50% cost-to-train savings over comparable GPU-based instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trainium has been optimized for training natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender models used. The accelerator supports a wide range of data types, including FP32, TF32, BF16, FP16, UINT8, and configurable FP8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest Trainium instance, the `trn1.32xlarge` comes with over 500GB of memory, making it easy to fine-tune ~10B parameter models on a single instance. Below you will find an overview of the available instance types. More details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/en/ec2/instance-types/trn1/#Product_details):\n",
    "\n",

    "Now we know what Trainium offers, let's get started. 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This tutorial was created on a trn1.2xlarge AWS EC2 Instance.* \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup AWS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the `trn1.2xlarge` instance on AWS with 1 Accelerator, including two Neuron Cores and the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the instance is up and running, we can ssh into it. But instead of developing inside a terminal we want to use a `Jupyter` environment, which we can use for preparing our dataset and launching the training. For this, we need to add a port for forwarding in the `ssh` command, which will tunnel our localhost traffic to the Trainium instance.\n",

    "PUBLIC_DNS=\"\" # IP address, e.g. ec2-3-80-....\n",
    "KEY_PATH=\"\" # local path to key, e.g. ssh/trn.pem\n",

    "ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -i ${KEY_NAME}.pem ubuntu@$PUBLIC_DNS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make sure we have the  `training` extra installed, to get all the necessary dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install .[training]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now start our **`jupyter`** server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m notebook --allow-root --port=8080\n",

    "We are going to use the Jupyter environment only for preparing the dataset and then `torchrun` for launching our training script on both neuron cores for distributed training. Lets create a new notebook and get started. \n",

    "## 2. Load and process the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are training a Text Classification model on the [emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) dataset to keep the example straightforward. The `emotion` is a dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.\n",
