    "## Quick intro: AWS Trainium\n",
    "\n",
    "[AWS Trainium (Trn1)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) is a purpose-built EC2 for deep learning (DL) training workloads. Trainium is the successor of [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/?nc1=h_ls) focused on high-performance training workloads. Trainium has been optimized for training natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender models used. The accelerator supports a wide range of data types, including FP32, TF32, BF16, FP16, UINT8, and configurable FP8. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest Trainium instance, the `trn1.32xlarge` comes with over 500GB of memory, making it easy to fine-tune ~10B parameter models on a single instance. Below you will find an overview of the available instance types. More details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/#Product_details):\n",

    "## 1. Setup AWS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the `trn1.32xlarge` instance on AWS with 16 Accelerator, including 32 Neuron Cores and the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2). The Hugging Face AMI comes with all important libraries, like Transformers, Datasets, Optimum and Neuron packages pre-installed this makes it super easy to get started, since there is no need for environment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post doesn’t cover how to create the instance in detail. You can check out my previous blog about [“Setting up AWS Trainium for Hugging Face Transformers”](https://www.philschmid.de/setup-aws-trainium), which includes a step-by-step guide on setting up the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the instance is up and running, we can ssh into it. But instead of developing inside a terminal we want to use a `Jupyter` environment, which we can use for preparing our dataset and launching the training. For this, we need to add a port for forwarding in the `ssh` command, which will tunnel our localhost traffic to the Trainium instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "PUBLIC_DNS=\"\" # IP address, e.g. ec2-3-80-....\n",
    "KEY_PATH=\"\" # local path to key, e.g. ssh/trn.pem\n",

    "ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -i ${KEY_NAME}.pem ubuntu@$PUBLIC_DNS\n",
    "```\n",

    "Lets now pull the optimum repository with the [example notebook and scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/notebooks/text-generation).\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron.git\n",

    "\n",

    "* [Sequence parallelism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05198.pdf) shards the activations on the sequence axis outside of the tensor parallel regions. It is useful because it saves memory by sharding the activations.\n",
