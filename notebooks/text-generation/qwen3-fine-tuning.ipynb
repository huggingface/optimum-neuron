    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach how to fine-tune open LLMs like [Qwen 3](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B) on AWS Trainium.  In our example, we are going to leverage Hugging Face Optimum Neuron, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "[AWS Trainium (Trn1)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) is a purpose-built EC2 for deep learning (DL) training workloads. Trainium is the successor of [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/?nc1=h_ls) focused on high-performance training workloads. Trainium has been optimized for training natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender models used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest Trainium instance, the `trn1.32xlarge` comes with over 500GB of memory, making it easy to fine-tune ~10B parameter models on a single instance. Below you will find an overview of the available instance types. More details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/en/ec2/instance-types/trn1/#Product_details):\n",

The Hugging Face AMI comes with all important libraries, like Transformers, Datasets, Optimum and Neuron packages pre-installed this makes it super easy to get started, since there is no need for environment management.\n",
