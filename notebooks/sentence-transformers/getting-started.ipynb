    "# Sentence Transformers on AWS Inferentia with Optimum Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to convert, load, and use [Sentence Transformers (SBERT)](https://www.sbert.net/) models on AWS Inferentia2 using Optimum Neuron, enabling efficient calculation of embeddings. Sentence Transformers are powerful model for generating sentence embeddings. You can use this Sentence Transformers to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for semantic textual similar, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.\n",

    "_Note: Currently only text models are supported, we are working on vision support for CLIP._\n",

    "## Convert Sentence Transformers model to AWS Inferentia2  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to convert your Sentence Transformers model to a format compatible with AWS Inferentia2. You can compile Sentence Transformers models with Optimum Neuron using the `optimum-cli` or `NeuronModelForSentenceTransformers` class. Below you will find an example for both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use the `NeuronModelForSentenceTransformers`, which can be used to convert any Sntence Transformers model to a format compatible with AWS Inferentia2 or load already converted models. When exporting models with the `NeuronModelForSentenceTransformers` you need to set `export=True` and define the input shape and batch size. The input shape is defined by the `sequence_length` and the batch size by `batch_size`. \n"

For loading the model we can use the `NeuronModelForSentenceTransformers` class, which is an abstraction layer for the `SentenceTransformer` class. The `NeuronModelForSentenceTransformers` class will automatically pad the input to the specified `sequence_length` and run inference on AWS Inferentia2."
