    "# Sentence Transformers on AWS Inferentia with Optimum Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to convert, load, and use [Sentence Transformers (SBERT)](https://www.sbert.net/) models on AWS Inferentia2 using Optimum Neuron, enabling efficient calculation of embeddings. Sentence Transformers are powerful models for generating sentence embeddings. You can use this Sentence Transformers to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for semantic textual similarities, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.\n",
