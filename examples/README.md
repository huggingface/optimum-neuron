# ðŸ¤— Transformers example scripts on AWS Trainium with Optimum Neuron

The following example scripts have been taken from the [official ðŸ¤— Transformers example directory](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch) and adapted to use the `TrainiumTrainer`:

```diff
- from transformers import Trainer
+ from optimum.neuron import TrainiumTrainer as Trainer
```

While this is not *mandatory*, using the `TraniumTrainer` over the regular `Trainer` offers some advantages:

- Sanity checks are done preventing you to provide training argument values that do not behave well with Trainium. This can be disabled by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_STRICT_MODE=false`.

- Some modifications are performed during the precompilation phase that can help avoiding recompilation during training.

- Some models will not work out of the box, and the `TraniumTrainer` takes care of patching them accordingly, at least for the supported models.


That being said, you can use those examples exactly as you would use the official examples from the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.
Feel free to check there if you have any usage related questions!
