# Optimum Neuron Distributed

The `optimum.neuron.distributed` module provides a set of tools to perform distributed training and inference.

## Parallelization

The main task in distributed training / inference is being able to shard things such as the model weights, the gradient, and/or the optimizer state. We built `Parallelizer` classes to handle the sharding.

### Base `Parallelizer`

The [`~optimum.neuron.distributed.Parallelizer`] class is the base abstract class being derived for every model supporting model parallelism. It provides methods to parallelize the model and save and load sharded checkpoints.

  - parallelize
  - optimizer_for_tp
  - save_model_checkpoint
  - load_model_checkpoint

### Selecting Model-Specific Parallelizer Classes

Each model that supports parallelization in `optimum-neuron` has its own derived `Parallelizer` class. The factory class [`~optimum.neuron.distributed.ParallelizersManager`] allows you to retrieve such model-specific `Parallelizer`s easily.

## Utils

### Lazy Loading

Distributed training / inference is usually needed when the model is too big to fit in one device. Tools that allow for lazy loading of model weights and optimizer states are thus needed to avoid going out-of-memory before parallelization.
