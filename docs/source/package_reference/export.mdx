# Inferentia Exporter

You can export a PyTorch model to Neuron with ðŸ¤— Optimum to run inference on AWS [Inferntia 1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/)
and [Inferentia 2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/).

## Export functions

There is an export function for each generation of the Inferentia accelerator, [`~optimum.exporters.neuron.convert.export_neuron`]
for INF1 and [`~optimum.exporters.onnx.convert.export_neuronx`] on INF2, but you will be able to use directly the export function [`~optimum.exporters.neuron.convert.export`], which will select the proper
exporting function according to the environment.

Besides, you can check if the exported model is valid via [`~optimum.exporters.neuron.convert.validate_model_outputs`], which compares
the compiled model's output on Neuron devices to the PyTorch model's output on CPU.
