# NeuronTrainer

The [`NeuronTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer#optimum.neuron.NeuronTrainer) class provides an extended API for the feature-complete [Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer). It is used in all the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples).

<Tip warning={true}>

The [`NeuronTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer#optimum.neuron.NeuronTrainer) class is optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers models running on AWS Trainium.

</Tip>

Here is an example of how to customize [`NeuronTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer#optimum.neuron.NeuronTrainer) to use a weighted loss (useful when you have an unbalanced training set):

```python
from torch import nn
from optimum.neuron import NeuronTrainer


class CustomNeuronTrainer(NeuronTrainer):
    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False):
        labels = inputs.get("labels")
        # forward pass
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.get("logits")
        # compute custom loss (suppose one has 3 labels with different weights)
        loss_fct = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
        loss = loss_fct(logits.view(-1, self.model.config.num_labels), labels.view(-1))
        return (loss, outputs) if return_outputs else loss
```

Another way to customize the training loop behavior for the PyTorch [`NeuronTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer#optimum.neuron.NeuronTrainer) is to use [callbacks](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/callback) that can inspect the training loop state (for progress reporting, logging on TensorBoard or other ML platforms...) and take decisions (like early stopping).
