# Quickstart

ðŸ¤— Optimum Neuron was designed with one goal in mind: **to make training and inference straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of AWS Accelerators**.
There are two main classes one needs to know:
- TrainiumArgumentParser: inherits the original [HfArgumentParser](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/trainer_utils#transformers.HfArgumentParser) in Transformers with additional checks on the argument values to make sure that they will work well with AWS Trainium instances.
- [TrainiumTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer): the trainer class that takes care of compiling and distributing the model to run on Trainium Chips, and performing training and evaluation.

The [TrainiumTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer) is very similar to the [ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer), and adapting a script using the Trainer to make it work with Trainium will mostly consist in simply swapping the `Trainer` class for the `TrainiumTrainer` one.
That's how most of the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples) were adapted from their [original counterparts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch).

modifications:

```diff
from transformers import TrainingArguments
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.neuron import TrainiumTrainer as Trainer
training_args = TrainingArguments(
  # training arguments...
)
# A lot of code here
# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,  # Original training arguments.
    train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset if training_args.do_eval else None,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```
