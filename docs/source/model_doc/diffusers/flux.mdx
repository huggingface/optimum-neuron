# Flux

Flux is a series of text-to-image generation models based on diffusion transformers.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using a `inf2.24xlarge` instance with tensor parallel size 8 for the model compilation and inference.

### Export to Neuron

* Option 1: CLI

```bash
optimum-cli export neuron --model black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev --tensor_parallel_size 8 --batch_size 1 --height 1024 --width 1024 --num_images_per_prompt 1 --torch_dtype bfloat16 flux_dev_neuron/
```

* Option 2: Python API

```python
from optimum.neuron import NeuronFluxPipeline

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compiler_args = {"auto_cast": "none"}
    input_shapes = {"batch_size": 1, "height": 1024, "width": 1024}

    pipe = NeuronFluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
        "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev",
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        export=True,
        tensor_parallel_size=8,
        **compiler_args,
        **input_shapes
    )

    # Save locally
    pipe.save_pretrained("flux_dev_neuron_1024_tp8/")

    # Upload to the HuggingFace Hub
    pipe.push_to_hub(
        "flux_dev_neuron_1024_tp8/", repository_id="Jingya/FLUX.1-dev-neuronx-1024x1024-tp8"  # Replace with your HF Hub repo id
    )
```

## Guidance-distilled

* The guidance-distilled variant takes about 50 sampling steps for good-quality generation.

```python
from optimum.neuron import NeuronFluxPipeline

pipe = NeuronFluxPipeline.from_pretrained("flux_dev_neuron_1024_tp8/")
prompt = "A cat holding a sign that says hello world"
out = pipe(
    prompt,
    guidance_scale=3.5,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(0)
).images[0]
out.save("flux_optimum.png")
```
