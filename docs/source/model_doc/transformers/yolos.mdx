# YOLOS

## Overview

The YOLOS model was proposed in [You Only Look at One Sequence: Rethinking Transformer in Vision through Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00666) by Yuxin Fang, Bencheng Liao, Xinggang Wang, Jiemin Fang, Jiyang Qi, Rui Wu, Jianwei Niu, Wenyu Liu.
YOLOS proposes to just leverage the plain [Vision Transformer (ViT)](vit) for object detection, inspired by DETR. It turns out that a base-sized encoder-only Transformer can also achieve 42 AP on COCO, similar to DETR and much more complex frameworks such as Faster R-CNN.

## Export to Neuron

To deploy ðŸ¤— [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) models on Neuron devices, you first need to compile the models and export them to a serialized format for inference. Below are two approaches to compile the model, you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Here we take the `feature-extraction` as an example:

### Option 1: CLI
  
You can export the model using the Optimum command-line interface as follows:

```bash
optimum-cli export neuron --model hustvl/yolos-tiny --task object-detection --batch_size 1 yolos_object_detection_neuronx/
```

> [!TIP]
> Execute `optimum-cli export neuron --help` to display all command line options and their description.

### Option 2: Python API

```python
from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForObjectDetection
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor


preprocessor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("hustvl/yolos-tiny")
neuron_model = NeuronModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("hustvl/yolos-tiny", export=True, batch_size=1)

neuron_model.save_pretrained("yolos_object_detection_neuronx")
neuron_model.push_to_hub(
    "yolos_object_detection_neuronx", repository_id="optimum/yolos-tiny-neuronx-bs1"  # Replace with your HF Hub repo id
)
```
