# Neuron Model Cache

The Neuron Model Cache is a remote cache for compiled Neuron models in the `neff` format.
It is integrated into the `NeuronTrainer` and `NeuronModelForCausalLM` classes to enable loading pretrained models from the cache instead of compiling them locally.

**Note: it is not available for models exported using any other NeuronModelXX classes, that use a different export mechanism.**

The Neuron Model Cache is hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/aws-neuron/optimum-neuron-cache) and includes compiled files for all popular and supported `optimum-neuron` pre-trained models.

Before training a Transformers or Diffusion model or loading a NeuronModelForCausalLM on Neuron platforms, it needs to be exported to neuron format
with [`torch-neuronx`](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-samples/tree/master/torch-neuronx).

When exporting a model, [`torch-neuronx`](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-samples/tree/master/torch-neuronx) will:

- convert it to a set of [XLA](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/) subgraphs,
- compile each subgraph with the neuronx compiler into a Neuron Executable File Format (NEFF) binary file.

The first step is relatively fast, but the compilation takes a lot of time.
To avoid recompiling all NEFF files every time a model is loaded on a NeuronX host, [`torch-neuronx`](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-samples/tree/master/torch-neuronx)
 stores NEFF files in a local directory, usually `/var/tmp/neuron-compile-cache`.

However, this local cache is not shared between platforms, which means that every time you train or export a model on a new host, you need to recompile it.

We created the Neuron Model Cache to solve this limitation by providing a public repository of precompiled model graphs.

Note: we also support the creation of private, secured, remote model cache.

## How to use the Neuron model cache

The public model cache will be used when you use the `NeuronTrainer` or `NeuronModelForCausalLM` classes. There are no additional changes needed.

When exporting a model to neuron format, `optimum-neuron` will simply look for cached NEFF files in the hub repository during the compilation of the
model subgraphs.

If the NEFF files are cached, they will be fetched from the hub and directly loaded instead of being recompiled.

## How caching works

The Optimum Neuron Cache is built on top of the [NeuronX compiler cache](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/arch/neuron-features/neuron-caching.html).

It is important to understand that the cache operates on NEFF binaries, and not on the model itself.

As explained previously, each model exported to Neuron using the `NeuronTrainer` or `NeuronModelForCausalLM` is composed of [XLA](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/) subgraphs.

Each subgraph is unique, and results from the combination of:
- the `transformers` or `transformers_neuronx` python modeling code,
- the `transformers` model config,
- the `input_shapes` selected during the export,
- The precision of the model, full-precision, fp16 or bf16.

When compiling a subgraph to a NEFF file, other parameters influence the result:
- The version of the Neuron X compiler,
- The number of Neuron cores used,
- The compilation parameters (such as the optimization level).

All these parameters are combined together to create a unique hash that identifies a NEFF file.

This has two very important consequences:
- it is only when actually exporting a model that the associated NEFF files can be identified,
- even a small change in the model configuration will lead to a different set of NEFF files.

It is therefore very difficult to know in advance if the NEFFs associated to a specific model configuration are cached.

## Neuron model cache lookup (inferentia only)

The neuron cache lookup is a feature allowing users to look for compatible cached model configurations before exporting
a model for inference.

It is based on a dedicated registry composed of stored cached configurations.

Cached model configurations are stored as entries under a specific subfolder in the Neuron Model Cache:

```
neuronxcc-2.12.54.0+f631c2365
├── 0_REGISTRY
│   └── 0.0.18
│       └── llama
│           └── meta-llama
│               └── Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
│                   └── 54c1f6689cd88f246fce.json
```

Each entry corresponds to the combination of a model configuration and its export parameters: this is as close as we can get to
uniquely identify the exported model.

You can use the `optimum-cli` to lookup for compatible cached entries by passing it a hub model_id or the path to a file
containing a model `config.json`.

```shell
$ optimum-cli neuron cache lookup meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

*** 1 entrie(s) found in cache for meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf ***

task: text-generation
batch_size: 1
num_cores: 24
auto_cast_type: fp16
sequence_length: 2048
compiler_type: neuronx-cc
compiler_version: 2.12.54.0+f631c2365
checkpoint_id: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
checkpoint_revision: c1b0db933684edbfe29a06fa47eb19cc48025e93
```

**Note that even if compatible cached entries exist, this does not always guarantee that the model will not be recompiled during export
if you modified the compilation parameters or updated the neuronx packages.**

## Advanced usage (trainium only)

### How to use a private Neuron model cache (trainium only)

The repository for the public cache is `aws-neuron/optimum-neuron-cache`. This repository includes all precompiled files for commonly used models so that it is publicly available and free to use for everyone. But there are two limitations:

1. You will not be able to push your own compiled files on this repo
2. It is public and you might want to use a private repo for private models

To alleviate that you can create your own private cache repository using the `optimum-cli` or set the environment variable `CUSTOM_CACHE_REPO`.

#### Using the Optimum CLI

The Optimum CLI offers 2 subcommands for cache creation and setting:

- `create`: To create a new cache repository that you can use as a private Neuron Model cache.
- `set`: To set the name of the Neuron cache repository locally, the repository needs to exists
and will be used by default by `optimum-neuron`.

Create a new Neuron cache repository:

```
optimum-cli neuron cache create --help

usage: optimum-cli neuron cache create [-h] [-n NAME] [--public]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NAME, --name NAME  The name of the repo that will be used as a remote cache for the compilation files.
  --public              If set, the created repo will be public. By default the cache repo is private.

```

The `-n` / `--name` option allows you to specify a name for the Neuron cache repo, if not set the default name will be used. The `--public` flag allows you to make your Neuron cache public as it will be created as a private repository by default.

Example:

```
optimum-cli neuron cache create

Neuron cache created on the Hugging Face Hub: michaelbenayoun/optimum-neuron-cache [private].
Neuron cache name set locally to michaelbenayoun/optimum-neuron-cache in /home/michael/.cache/huggingface/optimum_neuron_custom_cache.
```

Set a different Trainiun cache repository:

```
usage: optimum-cli neuron cache set [-h] name

positional arguments:
  name        The name of the repo to use as remote cache.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Example:

```
optimum-cli neuron cache set michaelbenayoun/optimum-neuron-cache

Neuron cache name set locally to michaelbenayoun/optimum-neuron-cache in /home/michael/.cache/huggingface/optimum_neuron_custom_cache
```

<Tip>

The `optimum-cli neuron cache set` command is useful when working on a new instance to use your own cache.

</Tip>

#### Using the environment variable `CUSTOM_CACHE_REPO`

Using the CLI is not always feasible, and not very practical for small testing. In this case, you can simply set the environment variable `CUSTOM_CACHE_REPO`.

For example, if your cache repo is called `michaelbenayoun/my_custom_cache_repo`, you just need to do:

```bash
CUSTOM_CACHE_REPO="michaelbenayoun/my_custom_cache_repo" torchrun ...
```

or:

```bash
export CUSTOM_CACHE_REPO="michaelbenayoun/my_custom_cache_repo"
torchrun ...
```

You have to be [logged into the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login) to be able to push  and pull files from your private cache repository.

### Cache system flow

</p>


At each the beginning of each training step, the  [`NeuronTrainer`] computes a `NeuronHash` and checks the cache repo(s) (official and custom) on the Hugging Face Hub to see if there are compiled files associated to this hash.
If that is the case, the files are downloaded directly to the local cache directory and no compilation is needed. Otherwise compilation is performed.


Just as for downloading compiled files, the [`NeuronTrainer`] will keep track of the newly created compilation files at each training step, and upload them to the Hugging Face Hub at save time or when training ends. This assumes that you have writing access to the cache repo, otherwise nothing will be pushed.


## Optimum CLI

The Optimum CLI can be used to perform various cache-related tasks, as described by the `optimum-cli neuron cache` command usage message:

```
usage: optimum-cli neuron cache [-h] {create,set,add,list} ...

positional arguments:
  {create,set,add,list,synchronize,lookup}
    create              Create a model repo on the Hugging Face Hub to store Neuron X compilation files.
    set                 Set the name of the Neuron cache repo to use locally (trainium only).
    add                 Add a model to the cache of your choice (trainium only).
    list                List models in a cache repo (trainium only).
    synchronize         Synchronize local compiler cache with the hub cache (inferentia only).
    lookup              Lookup the neuronx compiler hub cache for the specified model id (inferentia only).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

### Add a model to the cache (trainium only)

It is possible to add a model compilation files to a cache repo via the `optimum-cli neuron cache add` command:

```
usage: optimum-cli neuron cache add [-h] -m MODEL --task TASK --train_batch_size TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE [--eval_batch_size EVAL_BATCH_SIZE] [--sequence_length SEQUENCE_LENGTH]
                                    [--encoder_sequence_length ENCODER_SEQUENCE_LENGTH] [--decoder_sequence_length DECODER_SEQUENCE_LENGTH]
                                    [--gradient_accumulation_steps GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS] --precision {fp,bf16} --num_cores
                                    {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32} [--max_steps MAX_STEPS]
```

When running this command a small training session will be run and the resulting compilation files will be pushed.

<Tip warning={true}>
Make sure that the Neuron cache repo to use is set up locally, this can be done by running the `optimum-cli neuron cache set` command.
You also need to make sure that you are logged in to the Hugging Face Hub and that you have the writing rights for the specified cache repo,
this can be done via the `huggingface-cli login` command.

If at least one of those requirements is not met, the command will fail.
</Tip>


Example:

```
optimum-cli neuron cache add \
  --model prajjwal1/bert-tiny \
  --task text-classification \
  --train_batch_size 16 \
  --eval_batch_size 16 \
  --sequence_length 128 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 32 \
  --num_cores 32 \
  --precision bf16
```

This will push compilation files for the `prajjwal1/bert-tiny` model on the Neuron cache repo that was set up for the specified parameters.

### List a cache repo

It can also be convenient to request the cache repo to know which compilation files are available. This can be done via the `optimum-cli neuron cache list` command:

```
usage: optimum-cli neuron cache list [-h] [-m MODEL] [-v VERSION] [name]

positional arguments:
  name                  The name of the repo to list. Will use the locally saved cache repo if left unspecified.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        The model name or path of the model to consider. If left unspecified, will list all available models.
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        The version of the Neuron X Compiler to consider. Will list all available versions if left unspecified.
```

As you can see, it is possible to:

- List all the models available for all compiler versions.
- List all the models available for a given compiler version by specifying the `-v / --version` argument.
- List all compilation files for a given model, there can be many for different input shapes and so on, by specifying the `-m / --model` argument.


Example:

```
optimum-cli neuron cache list aws-neuron/optimum-neuron-cache
```
