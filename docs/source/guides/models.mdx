# Neuron Model Inference

*The APIs presented in the following documentation are relevant for the inference on [inf2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/), 
[trn1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) and [inf1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/).*

`NeuronModelForXXX` classes help to load models from the [Hugging Face Hub](hf.co/models) and compile them to a serialized format optimized for 
neuron devices. You will then be able to load the model and run inference with the acceleration powered by AWS Neuron devices.

## Switching from Transformers to Optimum

The `optimum.neuron.NeuronModelForXXX` model classes are APIs compatible with Hugging Face Transformers models. This means seamless integration 
with Hugging Face's ecosystem. You can just replace your `AutoModelForXXX` class with the corresponding `NeuronModelForXXX` class in `optimum.neuron`.

If you already use Transformers, you will be able to reuse your code just by replacing model classes:

```diff
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
-from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
+from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForSequenceClassification

# PyTorch checkpoint
-model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english") 

# Compile your model during the first time
+input_shapes = {"batch_size": 1, "sequence_length": 64}
+model = NeuronModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
+    "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", export=True, **input_shapes
+) 

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
inputs = tokenizer("Hamilton is considered to be the best musical of human history.", return_tensors="pt")

logits = model(**inputs).logits
print(model.config.id2label[logits.argmax().item()])
# 'POSITIVE'
```

As shown above, when you use `NeuronModelForXXX` for the first time, you will need to set `export=True` to compile your model from PyTorch to a neuron-compatible format.

`input_shapes` are mandatory static shape information that you need to send to the neuron compiler. Wondering what shapes are mandatory for your model? Check it out 
with the following code:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from optimum.exporters import TasksManager

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

# Infer the task name if you don't know
>>> task = TasksManager.infer_task_from_model(model)  # 'text-classification'

>>> neuron_config_constructor = TasksManager.get_exporter_config_constructor(
...     model=model, exporter="neuron", task='text-classification'
... )
>>> print(neuron_config_constructor.func.get_mandatory_axes_for_task(task))
# ('batch_size', 'sequence_length') 
```

<Tip>

Be careful, the input shapes used for compilation should be inferior than the size of inputs that you will feed into the model during the inference.

</Tip>

<Tip>

- What if input sizes are smaller than compilation input shapes?

No worries, `NeuronModelForXXX` class will pad your inputs to an eligible shape. Besides you can set `dynamic_batch_size=True` in the `from_pretrained` method to enable dynamic batching, which means that your inputs can have variable batch size.



*(Just keep in mind: dynamicity and padding comes with not only flexibility but also performance drop. Fair enough!)*

</Tip>

Once your model is compiled, you can save it either on your local or in the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://hf.co/models):

```python
>>> from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the model from the hub and export it to the Neuron optimized format
>>> input_shapes = {"batch_size": 1, "sequence_length": 64}
>>> model = NeuronModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
...     "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", export=True, **input_shapes
... )

# Save the compiled model
>>> model.save_pretrained("a_local_path_for_compiled_neuron_model")

# Push the onnx model to HF Hub
>>> model.push_to_hub(  # doctest: +SKIP
...     "a_local_path_for_compiled_neuron_model", repository_id="my-neuron-repo", use_auth_token=True
... )
```

And the next time when you want to run inference, just load your compiled model which will save you the compilation time:

```python
>>> from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForSequenceClassification
>>> model = NeuronModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("my-neuron-repo")
```

As you see, there is no need to precise shape information and compilation arguments used during the compilation as they are 
saved in a `config.json` file, and will be restored automatically by `NeuronModelForXXX` class.

Happy inference with Neuron! ðŸš€
