# Set up AWS Trainium instance

In this guide, we will show you:

1. How to create an AWS Trainium instance
2. How to use and run Jupyter Notebooks on your instance

## Create an AWS Trainium Instance

The simplest way to work with AWS Trainium and Hugging Face Transformers is the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2) (DLAMI). The DLAMI comes with all required libraries pre-packaged for you, including the Neuron Drivers, Transformers, Datasets, and Accelerate.

To create an EC2 Trainium instance, you can start from the console or the Marketplace. This guide will start from the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v2/).

Starting from the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v2/) in the us-east-1 region, You first click on **Launch an instance** and define a name for the instance (`trainium-huggingface-demo`).

  alt="name instance"
/>

Next, you search the Amazon Marketplace for Hugging Face AMIs. Entering “Hugging Face” in the search bar for “Application and OS Images” and hitting “enter”.

  alt="search ami"
/>

This should now open the “Choose an Amazon Machine Image” view with the search. You can now navigate to “AWS Marketplace AMIs” and find the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2) and click select.

  alt="select ami"
/>

_You will be asked to subscribe if you aren’t. The AMI is completely free of charge, and you will only pay for the EC2 compute._

Then you need to define a key pair, which will be used to connect to the instance via `ssh`. You can create one in place if you don't have a key pair.

  alt="select ssh key"
/>

After that, create or select a [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html). Important you want to allow `ssh` traffic.

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/main/docs/assets/guides/setup_aws_instance/05-select-sh.png"
  alt="select security group"
/>

You are ready to launch our instance. Therefore click on “Launch Instance” on the right side.

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/main/docs/assets/guides/setup_aws_instance/06-launch-instance.png"
  alt="select ssh key"
/>

AWS will now provision the instance using the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2). Additional configurations can be made by increasing the disk space or creating an instance profile to access other AWS services.

After the instance runs, you can view and copy the public IPv4 address to `ssh` into the machine.

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/main/docs/assets/guides/setup_aws_instance/07-copy-dns.png"
  alt="select public dns"
/>

Replace the empty strings `""` in the snippet below with the IP address of your instances and the path to the key pair you created/selected when launching the instance.

```bash
PUBLIC_DNS="" # IP address
KEY_PATH="" # local path to key pair

ssh -i $KEY_PATH ubuntu@$PUBLIC_DNS
```

After you are connected, you can run `neuron-ls` to ensure you have access to the Trainium accelerators. You should see a similar output than below.

```json
ubuntu@ip-172-31-79-164:~$ neuron-ls
instance-type: trn1.2xlarge
instance-id: i-0570615e41700a481
+--------+--------+--------+---------+
| NEURON | NEURON | NEURON |   PCI   |
| DEVICE | CORES  | MEMORY |   BDF   |
+--------+--------+--------+---------+
| 0      | 2      | 32 GB  | 00:1e.0 |
+--------+--------+--------+---------+
```

## Configuring `Jupyter Notebook` on your AWS Trainium Instance

With the instance is up and running, we can ssh into it. 
But instead of developing inside a terminal it is also possible to use a `Jupyter Notebook` environment. We can use it for preparing our dataset and launching the training (at least when working on a single node). 

For this, we need to add a port for forwarding in the `ssh` command, which will tunnel our localhost traffic to the Trainium instance.

```bash
PUBLIC_DNS="" # IP address, e.g. ec2-3-80-....
KEY_PATH="" # local path to key, e.g. ssh/trn.pem

ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -i ${KEY_NAME}.pem ubuntu@$PUBLIC_DNS
```

You are done! You can now start using the Trainium accelerators with Hugging Face Transformers. Check out the [Fine-tune Transformers with AWS Trainium](./fine_tune) guide to get started.
