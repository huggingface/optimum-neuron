# Fine-tune Transformers with AWS Trainium

Training on AWS Trainium is as simple as in Transformers:

- You need to replace the Transformers' [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class with the [`TrainiumTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/neuron/package_reference/trainer) class.

You can find several examples in the official repository for the following tasks:

- [language modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/language-modeling),
- [question answering](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/question-answering),
- [summarization](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/summarization),
- [text classification](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/text-classification),
- [translation](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/translation),
- [image classification](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/image-classification),
- [audio classification](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/audio-classification),
- [speech recognition](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/speech-recognition),
- [contrastive image-text training](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/examples/contrastive-image-text).

If you want go through an step-by-step example check out the [getting started with AWS Trainium and Hugging Face Transformers](../tutorials/fine_tune_bert) guide.
