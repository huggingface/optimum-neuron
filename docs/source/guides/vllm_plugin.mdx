# optimum-neuron plugin for vLLM

The `optimum-neuron` package includes a [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) plugin
that registers an 'optimum-neuron' vLLM platform specifically designed to ease the deployment
 of models hosted on the Hugging Face hub to AWS Trainium and Inferentia.

This platform supports two modes of operation:
- it can be used for the inference of pre-exported Neuron models directly from the hub,
- but it allows also the simplified deployment of vanilla models directly without recompilation using [cached artifacts](#hugging-face-neuron-cache).

Notes
- only a relevant subset of all possible configurations for a given model are cached,
- you can use the `optimum-cli` to get all [cached configurations](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/guides/cache_system#neuron-model-cache-lookup-inferentia-only) for each model.
- to deploy models that are not cached on the Hugging Face hub, you need to [export](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/main/en/guides/export_model)
 them beforehand.

## Setup

The easiest way to use the `optimum-neuron` vLLM platform is to launch an Amazon ec2 instance using
 the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2).  If you decide NOT to make your life easier by using [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2), you can install this functionality into your Neuron environment with ```pip install optimum-neuron[neuronx,vllm]```.

Note: Trn2 instances are not supported by the `optimum-neuron` platform yet.

- After launching the instance, follow the instructions in [Connect to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) to connect to the instance
- Once inside your instance, activate the pre-installed `optimum-neuron` virtual environment by running

```console
source /opt/aws_neuronx_venv_pytorch_2_7/bin/activate
```

## Generating content programmatically

The easiest way to test a model is to use the python API:

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

prompts = [
    "Hello, my name is",
    "The president of the United States is",
    "The capital of France is",
    "The future of AI is",
]
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

llm = LLM(model="unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
          max_num_seqs=4,
          max_model_len=4096,
          tensor_parallel_size=2)

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

## Serving a model

The easiest way to serve a model is to use the `optimum-cli`:

```console
optimum-cli serve \
    --model="unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct" \
    --batch_size=4 \
    --sequence_length=4096 \
    --tensor_parallel_size=2 \
    --port=8080
```

You can also launch an Open AI compatible inference server directly using vLLM entry points:

```console
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model="unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct" \
    --max-num-seqs=4 \
    --max-model-len=4096 \
    --tensor-parallel-size=2 \
    --port=8080
```

Use the following command to test the model:

```console
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/v1/completions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"prompt":"One of my fondest memory is", "temperature": 0.8, "max_tokens":128}'
```
