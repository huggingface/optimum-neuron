# Inference pipelines with AWS Neuron (Inf2/Trn1)

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
for accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification, question answering and image classification.

<Tip>

You can also use the
[pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) function from
Transformers and provide your NeuronModel model class.

</Tip>

Currently the supported tasks are:

* `feature-extraction`
* `fill-mask`
* `text-classification`
* `token-classification`
* `question-answering`
* `text-generation`
* `image-classification`
* `image-segmentation`
* `object-detection`
* `automatic-speech-recognition`
* `audio-classification`

## Optimum pipeline usage

While each task has an associated pipeline class, it is simpler to use the general [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function which wraps all the task-specific pipelines in one object.
The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function automatically loads a default model and tokenizer/feature-extractor capable of performing inference for your task.

1. Start by creating a pipeline by specifying an inference task:

```python
>>> from optimum.neuron.pipelines import pipeline

>>> classifier = pipeline(task="text-classification")
```

2. Pass your input text/image to the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function:

```python
>>> classifier("I like you. I love you.")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998838901519775}]
```

_Note: The default models used in the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function are not optimized for inference or quantized, so there won't be a performance improvement compared to their PyTorch counterparts._

### Using vanilla Transformers model and converting to AWS Neuron

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function accepts any supported model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task.

<Tip>

To be able to load the model with the Neuron Runtime, the export to neuron needs
to be supported for the considered architecture.

You can check the list of supported architectures
[here](../package_reference/configuration#supported-architectures).

</Tip>

Once you have picked an appropriate model, you can create the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] by specifying the model repo:

```python
>>> from optimum.neuron.pipelines import pipeline

# The model will be loaded to an NeuronModelForQuestionAnswering.
>>> neuron_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", export=True)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = neuron_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

It is also possible to load it with the `from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, export=True)`
method associated with the `NeuronModelForXXX` class.

For example, here is how you can load the [`~neuron.NeuronModelForQuestionAnswering`] class for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForQuestionAnswering, pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> # Loading the PyTorch checkpoint and converting to the neuron format by providing export=True
>>> model = NeuronModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(
...     "deepset/roberta-base-squad2",
...     export=True
... )

>>> neuron_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = neuron_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

### Defining Input Shapes

NeuronModels currently require static `input_shapes` to run inference. The default input shapes will be used if you are not providing input shapes when providing the `export=True` parameter.
Below is an example of how to specify the input shapes for the sequence length and batch size.

```python
>>> from optimum.neuron.pipelines import pipeline

>>> input_shapes = {"batch_size": 1, "sequence_length": 64}
>>> clt = pipeline("token-classification", model="dslim/bert-base-NER", export=True,input_shapes=input_shapes)
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = clt(context)
```
