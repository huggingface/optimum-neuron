# [DRAFT] Continuous Pretraining of Llama 3.2 1B on SageMaker Hyperpod with Pre-built Containers

This tutorial demonstrates how to continuously pre-train the [Llama 3.2 1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) model using the Hugging Face [Optimum Neuron](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/index) library on [Amazon SageMaker Hyperpod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod.html). We leverage several performance optimizations such as tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, and ZeRO-1 to efficiently train large language models on Trainium-powered instances.

One of the key benefits of using SageMaker Hyperpod is the ability to leverage the pre-built Optimum Neuron containers provided by Hugging Face. These containers come with all the necessary libraries and dependencies pre-installed, making it easy to get started with training on AWS Trainium instances.


By using the SageMaker pre-built containers, you can avoid the hassle of manually setting up the environment and focus on the core training and fine-tuning tasks. The containers are optimized for performance and include various optimization techniques, such as tensor parallelism and selective checkpointing, to efficiently train large language models like Llama 3.2 1B.


## 1. Setup AWS Environment

Before starting this tutorial, you will need to set up your AWS environment:

1. Create an AWS SageMaker Hyperpod cluster with at least one `trn1.32xlarge` instance. You can follow the [Hyperpod EKS workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks/en-US/00-setup/own-account) to set up the cluster.
2. Since Llama 3.2 is a gated model users have to register in Hugging Face and obtain an [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) before running this example. You will also need to review and accept the license agreement on the [meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) model page.
3. Configure your AWS credentials. If you haven't already set up your AWS credentials, you can do this by installing the AWS CLI and running `aws configure`. You'll need to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format. 
   ```bash
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

## 2. Continuous Pretraining on SageMaker Hyperpod

In this toturial, we will use the pre-built script from Optimum-neuron. The script uses the `Trainer` class from the Optimum Neuron library, which is a specialized version of the Hugging Face Trainer optimized for training on AWS Trainium instances. 

Here's an overview of the main components in the script:

1. **Model Loading**: The model is loaded using `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()` with lazy loading for parallelism.

2. **Data Processing**: The dataset is tokenized and processed into chunks suitable for language modeling.

3. **Training Arguments**: The script uses `NeuronTrainingArguments` to configure training hyperparameters, including options for tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism.

4. **Trainer Setup**: A `Trainer` instance [`optimum.neuron.NeuronTrainer`] is created with the model, training arguments, datasets, and other necessary components.

5. **Training Loop**: The `trainer.train()` method is called to start the continuous pretraining process.

To run the pretraining job on the SageMaker Hyperpod cluster, we need to package the training script and dependencies into a Docker image and deploy it to the cluster. The Optimum Neuron repository includes a `Dockerfile` and a `generate-jobspec.sh` script that you can use as a starting point.

1. First download the script for the EKS job:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron.git
   mkdir ~/pre-training
   cd pre-training

   cp -r ../optimum-neuron/docs/source/training_tutorials/amazon_eks .
   cd amazon_eks
   ```
2. Login to ECR and pull the `huggingface-pytorch-training-neuronx` image

   ```
   region=us-east-1
   dlc_account_id=763104351884
   aws ecr get-login-password --region $region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $dlc_account_id.dkr.ecr.$region.amazonaws.com

   docker pull ${dlc_account_id}.dkr.ecr.${region}.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-training-neuronx:2.1.2-transformers4.43.2-neuronx-py310-sdk2.20.0-ubuntu20.04-v1.0
   ```

3. Build and push the Docker image to your ECR registry:

   ```
   export AWS_REGION=$(aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --output text --query 'AvailabilityZones[0].[RegionName]')
   export ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
   export REGISTRY=${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/
   export IMAGE=optimum-neuron-llama-pretraining
   export TAG=:latest

   docker build -t ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE}${TAG} .
   ```

4. Push the image to your private registry
   ```
   # Create registry if needed
   export REGISTRY_COUNT=$(aws ecr describe-repositories | grep \"${IMAGE}\" | wc -l)
   if [ "${REGISTRY_COUNT//[!0-9]/}" == "0" ]; then
      echo "Creating repository ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE} ..."
      aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ${IMAGE}
   else
      echo "Repository ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE} already exists"
   fi

   # Login to registry
   echo "Logging in to $REGISTRY ..."
   aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $REGISTRY

   # Push image to registry
   docker image push ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE}${TAG}
   ```

5. Next, you will generate the script to be used by the pre-training job. Begin by logging into Hugging Face using your access token mentioned in the prerequisite steps.
   Modify the `generate-jobspec.sh` script to include the Hugging Face access token before running it:

   ```bash
   export HF_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your_HF_token_here>"
   ```

6. Generate the Kubernetes job specification by executing `generate-jobspec.sh`. This will create a deployment manifest called `llama_train.yaml` for the Amazon SageMaker Hyperpod EKS cluster.

   ```
   ./generate-jobspec.sh
   ```

7. Deploy the training job to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f llama_train.yaml
   ```

   The manifest runs the following command on the cluster. The environment variables are set when creating the manifest in `generate-jobspec.sh`. You can explore the complete training script at [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/blob/main/examples/language-modeling/run_clm.py)
    ```
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=${NUM_NODES} run_clm.py \
        --model_name_or_path=${HF_MODEL_NAME}
        --token=${HF_ACCESS_TOKEN}
        --dataset_name=${DATASET_NAME}
        --dataset_config_name=${DATASET_CONFIG_NAME}
        --streaming=True
        --cache_dir=${TOKENIZED_DATA_PATH}
        --num_train_epochs=1
        --do_train
        --learning_rate=1e-4
        --max_steps=${MAX_STEPS}
        --per_device_train_batch_size=${BATCH_SIZE}
        --per_device_eval_batch_size=4
        --gradient_accumulation_steps=1
        --gradient_checkpointing
        --block_size=4096
        --bf16
        --torch_dtype=bfloat16
        --weight_decay=0.01
        --max_grad_norm=1.0
        --lr_scheduler_type=linear
        --tensor_parallel_size=8
        --pipeline_parallel_size=1
        --logging_steps=1
        --save_total_limit=1
        --output_dir=${CHECKPOINT_DIR}
        --overwrite_output_dir
    ```


   The training job will now start running on the SageMaker Hyperpod cluster. You can monitor the progress through Kubernetes logs:

   ```
   kubectl logs -f -n kubeflow -l app=llama-training-eks
   ```

   Once the pretraining is complete, you can fine-tune the model for specific tasks using the techniques covered in the previous tutorials.
