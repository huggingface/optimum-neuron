# [DRAFT]Llama 3 8B pretraining on SageMaker Hyperpod 


<Tip>

While we will use `Llama-3 8B` in this tutorial, it is completely possible to use other models, simply by swtiching the `model_id`.

</Tip>

## 1. Setup AWS Environment


## 2. Load and prepare the dataset

    
## 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning of Llama on AWS Trainium with the `NeuronSFTTrainer`


## 4. Launch Training


### Actual Training


Awesome, our model also correctly uses the provided context. We are done. Congrats on fine-tuning Llama on AWS Trainium.
