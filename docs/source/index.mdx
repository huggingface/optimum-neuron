# ðŸ¤— Optimum Neuron

ðŸ¤— Optimum Neuron is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and AWS Accelerators including [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/?nc1=h_ls) and [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/?nc1=h_ls).
It provides a set of tools enabling easy model loading, training and inference on single- and multi-Accelerator settings for different downstream tasks.
The list of officially validated models and tasks is available [here](TODO:).
