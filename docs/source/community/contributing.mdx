# Adding support for new architectures

You want to export and run a new model on AWS Inferentia or Trainium? Check the guideline, and submit a pull request to [ðŸ¤— Optimum Neuron's github repo](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/)! 

To support a new model architecture in the Optimum Neuron library here are some steps to follow:

1. Implement a custom Neuron configuration.
2. Export and validate the model.
3. Add tests.
4. Contribute to the github repo. 

## Implement a custom Neuron configuration

To support the export of a new model to Neuron compatible format, the first thing to do is to define a Neuron configuration, describing how to expot a PyTorch model to a Neuron compatible format, by specifying:

1. The input names.
2. The output names.
3. The dummy inputs used to trace the model. (This is needed by the Neuron Compiler to record the computational graph and embed it to a TorchScript module.)
4. The compilation arguments used to control the trade-off between hardware efficiency (latency, throughput) and accuracy.

Depending on the choice of model and task, we represent the data above with configuration classes. Each configuration class is associated with
a specific model architecture, and follows the naming convention `ArchitectureNameNeuronConfig`. For instance, the configuration which specifies the Neuron
export of BERT models is `BertNeuronConfig`.

Since many architectures share similar properties for their Neuron configuration, ðŸ¤— Optimum adopts a 3-level class hierarchy:

1. Abstract and generic base classes. These handle all the fundamental features, while being agnostic to the modality (text, image, audio, etc).
2. Middle-end classes. These are aware of the modality. Multiple config classes could exist for the same modality depending on the inputs they support. They specify which input generators should be used for generating the dummy inputs, but remain model-agnostic.
3. Model-specific classes like the `BertNeuronConfig` mentioned above. These are the ones actually used to export models.

### Example: Adding support for ESM models

Here we take the suppport of [ESM models](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/esm#esm) as an example. Let's create a `EsmNeuronConfig` class in the `optimum/exporters/neuron/model_configs.py`.

When a Esm model interprets as text encoder, we are able to inherit from the middle-end class [`TextEncoderNeuronConfig`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/blob/v0.0.18/optimum/exporters/neuron/config.py#L36). 
Since the modeling and configuration of Esm is almost the same as BERT when it is interpreted as encoder, we can use the `NormalizedConfigManager` with `model_type=bert` to normalize the configuration in order to generate dummy inputs for tracing the model.

And one last step, since `optimum-neuron` is an extension of `optimum`, we need to register the Neuron config that we create to the [TasksManager](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/task_manager#optimum.exporters.TasksManager) with the `register_in_tasks_manager` by specifying the model type and supported tasks.

```python

@register_in_tasks_manager("esm", *["feature-extraction", "fill-mask", "text-classification", "token-classification"])
class EsmNeuronConfig(TextEncoderNeuronConfig):
    NORMALIZED_CONFIG_CLASS = NormalizedConfigManager.get_normalized_config_class("bert")
    ATOL_FOR_VALIDATION = 1e-3

    @property
    def inputs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["input_ids", "attention_mask"]

```

## Export and validate the model

With the Neuron config that you implemented, now do a quick test if it works as expected:

* Export

```bash
optimum-cli export neuron --model facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D --task text-classification --batch_size 1 --sequence_length 16 esm_neuron/
```

And then validate the outputs of your exported Neuron model by comparing to the results of PyTorch on CPU.

```python
from optimum.exporters.neuron import validate_model_outputs

validate_model_outputs(
    neuron_config, base_model, neuron_model_path, neuron_named_outputs, neuron_config.ATOL_FOR_VALIDATION
)
```

* Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from optimum.neuron import NeuronModelForSequenceClassification

model = NeuronModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("esm_neuron/")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("esm_neuron/")
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
logits = model(**inputs).logits
```

## Add tests

Add the model to the exporter test in [`optimum-neuron/tests/exporters/exporters_utils.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/blob/v0.0.18/tests/exporters/exporters_utils.py) and the inference test in [`optimum-neuron/tests/inference/inference_utils.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/blob/v0.0.18/tests/inference/inference_utils.py).

<Tip>

We usually test a smaller checkpoint to accelerate the CIs, you could find tiny models for testing under the [`Hugging Face Internal Testing Organization`](https://huggingface.co/hf-internal-testing).

## Contribute to the github repo

Now, just we are all set! Open a pull request and ping one Optimum-neuron maintainers to review your PR.


You have made a new model accessible on Neuron for the community! Thanks for joining us in the endeavor of democratizing good machine learning ðŸ¤—.
