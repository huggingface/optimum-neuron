# Optimum Neuron Container 

We provide pre-built Optimum Neuron containers for Amazon SageMaker. These containers come with all of the Hugging Face libraries and dependencies pre-installed, so you can start using them right away.
We have containers for training and inference, and optimized text generation containers with TGI. The table is up to date and only includes the latest versions of each container. You can find older versions in the [Deep Learning Container Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases?q=hf-neuronx&expanded=true)

We recommend using the `sagemaker` Python SDK to retrieve the image URI for the container you want to use.

Please replace `763104351884` with the correct [AWS account ID](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/image_uri_config/huggingface-neuronx.json) and `region` with the AWS region you are working in.
