# Supported architectures

## Training

Training a model on a Trainium instance requires:

    1. A model that can be compiled with the Neuron SDK.
    2. Either that:
        * The model is small enough to fit everything that is needed (model, gradients, optimizer states, activations) on one accelerator (16GB of memory per accelerator),
        * Or there is a custom modeling implementation adding support for tensor-parallelism and/or pipeline-parallelism for this model architecture in Optimum Neuron.

The following table lists the architectures and tasks with a custom modeling implementation that Optimum Neuron supports for training on Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances.

| Architecture             | Task            | Tensor Parallelism | Pipeline Parallelism | Expert Parallelism   |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Llama, Llama 2, Llama 3  | text-generation | ✓                  | ✓                    | N/A                  |
| Qwen3                    | text-generation | ✓                  | ✓                    | N/A                  |
| Granite                  | text-generation | ✓                  | ✗                    | N/A                  |



## Inference

The following table lists the architectures and tasks that Optimum Neuron supports for inference on Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances. 

<Tip>

If a LLM is listed, e.g. a model with a `text-generation` task, it means that there is also [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index) support for it.
