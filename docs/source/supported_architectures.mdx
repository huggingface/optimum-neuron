# Supported architectures

## Training

Training on AWS Trainium instances (Trn1) enables large-scale model training with distributed parallelism strategies.

**Requirements:**
- Model must be compatible with the Neuron SDK. If it small enough to fit within 16GB, training is supported for any architecture that can be successfully compiled.
- **Memory constraint:** Each accelerator has 16GB of memory for model weights, gradients, optimizer states, and activations.
- **For large models:** Custom modeling implementation with tensor parallelism and/or pipeline parallelism support is required.

The following architectures have custom modeling implementations with distributed training support:

| Architecture             | Task            | Tensor Parallelism | Pipeline Parallelism |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Llama, Llama 2, Llama 3  | text-generation | ✓                  | ✓                    |
| Qwen3                    | text-generation | ✓                  | ✓                    |
| Granite                  | text-generation | ✓                  | ✗                    |


<Tip>

If you need to add support for a custom model not listed above, check out our [contribute for training guide](./contribute/contribute_for_training) to learn how to implement custom modeling with distributed training support. You can also open an issue in the [Optimum Neuron GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/issues) to request support for it.

</Tip>


## Inference

The following table lists the architectures and tasks that Optimum Neuron supports for inference on Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances.

<Tip>

If a LLM is listed, e.g. a model with a `text-generation` task, it means that there is also [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index) support for it.
