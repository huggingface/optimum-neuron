# Installation

Our recommendation is to use the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2) (DLAMI). The DLAMI comes with all required libraries pre-packaged for you, including the Optimum Neuron, Neuron Drivers, Transformers, Datasets, and Accelerate.
But it can also be installed using `pip` as follows:

## Installing `optimum-neuron` for AWS Trainium (`trn1`) or AWS inferentia2 (`inf2`)

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[neuronx]
```

## Installing `optimum-neuron` for AWS inferentia (`inf1`)

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[neuron]
```

Before installing `optimum-neuron` make sure that you have installed the Neuron driver and tools, check out [more detailed guide here](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/setup/torch-neuronx.html#setup-torch-neuronx).
