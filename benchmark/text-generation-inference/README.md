# NeuronX TGI benchmark using multiple replicas

## Local environment setup

These configurations are tested and run on an inf2.48xlarge with the Hugging Face Deep Learning AMI from the AWS Marketplace.

Copy the configurations down using

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron.git
$ cd optimum-neuron/benchmark/text-generation-inference/
```


## Select model and configuration

Edit the `.env` file to select the model to use for the benchmark and its configuration.

The following instructions assume that you are testing a locally built image, so docker would have stored image neuronx-tgi:latest.

You can confirm this by running:

```shell
$ docker image ls
```

If you have not built it locally, you can download it and retag it using the following commands

```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/huggingface/neuronx-tgi:latest
$ docker tag ghcr.io/huggingface/neuronx-tgi:latest neuronx-tgi:latest
```
You should then see the single IMAGE ID with two different sets of tags:

```shell
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
neuronx-tgi                       latest    f5ba57f8517b   12 hours ago   11.3GB
ghcr.io/huggingface/neuronx-tgi   latest    f5ba57f8517b   12 hours ago   11.3GB
```


Alternatively, you can edit the appropriate docker-compose.yaml to supply the fully path by changing ```neuronx-tgi:latest``` to ```ghcr.io/huggingface/neuronx-tgi:latest```

## Start the servers

```shell
$ docker compose -f llama3-8b/docker-compose.yaml --env-file llama3-8b/.env up
```

Note: edit the .env file to change the model configuration

## Run the benchmark

### Install `llmperf`

Follow instalation [instructions](https://github.com/ray-project/llmperf/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for `llmperf`.

### Setup test environment

```shell
$ export LLMPerf=<path-to-llmperf>
```

### Launch benchmark run

The benchmark script takes the `model_id` and number of concurrent users as parameters.
The `model_id` must match the one corresponding to the selected `.env` file.

```
$ ./benchmark.sh NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf 128
```

If you would like to run the benchmark script multiple times with different concurrent user parameters, you can use:

```
$ ./run_all.sh NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct
```

### Compiling the model

If you are trying to run a configuration or a model that is not available in the cache, you can compile the model before you run it, then load it locally.

See the [llama3-70b-trn1.32xlarge](llama3-70b-trn1.32xlarge) as an example.

It is best to compile the model with the software in the container you will be using to ensure all library versions match.

As an example, you can compile with the following command.  **If you make changes, make sure your batch size, sequence length, and num_cores for compilation match the same settings in the .env file**

```
docker run -p 8080:80 \
-v $(pwd):/data \
--device=/dev/neuron0 \
--device=/dev/neuron1 \
--device=/dev/neuron2 \
--device=/dev/neuron3 \
--device=/dev/neuron4 \
--device=/dev/neuron5 \
--device=/dev/neuron6 \
--device=/dev/neuron7 \
--device=/dev/neuron8 \
--device=/dev/neuron9 \
--device=/dev/neuron10 \
--device=/dev/neuron11 \
--device=/dev/neuron12 \
--device=/dev/neuron13 \
--device=/dev/neuron14 \
--device=/dev/neuron15 \
-ti \
--entrypoint "optimum-cli" neuronx-tgi:latest \
export neuron --model NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct \
--sequence_length 4096 \
--batch_size 4 \
--num_cores 32 \
/data/exportedmodel/
```

Note that the .env file has a path for MODEL_ID to load the model from the /data directory.

Also, the docker-compose.yaml file includes an additional parameter to map the volume to the current working directory, as well as additional Neuron device mappings because trn1.32xlarge has 32 cores (16 devices).

Make sure you run the above command and the docker compose command from the same directory since it maps the /data directory to the current working directory.

For this example:
```
$ docker compose -f llama3-70b-trn1.32xlarge/docker-compose.yaml --env-file llama3-70b-trn1.32xlarge/.env up
```
